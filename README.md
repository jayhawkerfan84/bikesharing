For future analysis is to compare rides by seasons. The sample size we looked at was the month of September which generally has

nice weather. But what is the rides like in Jan and Feb? We can also take a look at the to and from destinations. Are the riders

going to houses, bars, parks, etc? What kind of population would do the same in Des Moines?
